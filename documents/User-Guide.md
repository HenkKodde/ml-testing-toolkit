### 1. Introduction

The intention of this document is to provide a basic user guide to the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**. This easy to use toolkit was designed for both technical and non-technical users, even though the primarily users would likely be Quality Assurance (QA) resources. By following this guide, users will have a better understand of the capabilities and functionality of the tool set.

The **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** was designed for participants that would like to participate in the Mojaloop scheme. Intentionally build to as a standard integration testing tool between a _Digital Financial Service Provider (DFSP)_ and the  Mojaloop Switch to facilitate testing. This tool set can potentially be used by both the DFSP and the Hub to verify the integration between the 2 entities.

For additional back ground information on the Self Testing Toolkit, please see [Mojaloop Testing Toolkit](/documents/Mojaloop-Testing-Tool.md). At the same time, understanding the [Architecture Diagram](/documents/Mojaloop√Ç-Testing-Tool.md#7-architecture) components and related flow, would be beneficial.

### 2. Getting Started

To get started, please follow instruction in the [README](/README.md) document. This document covers the use-cases with the **Mojaloop Simulator** and **Mojaloop Simulator _UI (User Interface)_**.

### 3. The Testing Tool

#### 3.1 At first glance

When you open the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** in your browser, you will be welcomed by the Dashboard display. Currently this is still under development, and only display "static data". The current static display will provide you with a fair representations of the intentional Dashboard functionality.

![Opening view](/assets/images/Opening_View.png)

You would also notice the navigation bar on the left. The navigational items currently are;

- Dashboard
- Monitoring
- Sync Response Rules
- Validation Rules (Error Callbacks)
- Callback Rules (Success Callbacks)
- Outbound Request
- Settings

We will work through each one of the items and provide you with a fair understanding of the current functionality.

![Menu Items](/assets/images/Menu_Items.png)

#### 3.2 Dashboard

The _Dashboard_ is the default opening screen. This is still under construction and will provide valuable statistical information to the user of the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** related to request and response activities (Request and Responses statistics, including Rules Engine "Hits" information).

More information would be available once the development is at a more mature stage.

#### 3.3 Monitoring

The _Monitoring_ navigation tab allows you to monitor the _incoming_ and _outgoing_ request.

![Monitoring Initial State](/assets/images/Monitoring_Initial_State.png) 

By following the docker installation instructions in the [README](/README.md), you should have the **Mojaloop Simulator UI** open in your browser tab. On the **Mojaloop Simulator UI** open browser, go to the navigation bar on the left and click on _Outbound Send_ tab.

Press _Send Transfer_ button on the main page to send sample test data from the **Mojaloop_Simulater UI** to the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**. 

![Send Transfer](/assets/images/Send_Transfer.png)

You should receive a response on the **Mojaloop Simulator UI** as indicated below. **Note** the variable data are generated randomly, so could differ than in the images provided below.

![Simulator response](/assets/images/Simulator_Response.png) 

Go back to the **Mojaloop Testing Toolset** in your browser and select from the navigation bar on the left the _Monitoring_ tab. You will notice the three requests associated with a transfer in an order such that most recent request first on the main page content.

- GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}
- POST /quotes
- POST /transfers

![Monitoring messages](/assets/images/Monitoring_Messages.png)

To view detail information on any one of the callback, click on the operation - in this example _GET /parties/MSISDN/0001_ persented as a _blue button_. 

If you recall the [Architecture Diagram](/documents/Mojaloop-Self-Testing-Tool.md#7-architecture) mentioned earlier, under messages, you'll notice, Version negotiation, Schema Validation and Additional validations;

Clicking on the _+_ to the left of the expanded list on the main page to view detail related to that specific timeline message.

![Expanded monitoring messages](/assets/images/Expand_Monitoring_Messages.png)

As an example for this document, the above messages in the image has be expanded to provide better insight.

- Request: get/parties/MSISDN/000111
  - This contains the body of the request
- Version negotiation succeeded, picked up the version 1.0
  - Confirm the API version that was used
- Callback rules are matched
  - The callback rule used in this process. This can be customized, and will be covered later in this document
- Received callback response 200 OK
  - The http response for the previous step "Sending callback put /parties/MSISDN/000111"

When you send more transfers from the **Mojaloop Simulator UI**, these transactions will be added to the monitoring event.

![Additional transfers](/assets/images/Additional_Transfers.png)

#### 3.4 Sync Response Rules

**_Validation and synchronous response based on the schema of the code_**

The _Sync Response Rules_ navigation tab on the left of the **Mojaloop Testing Toolset** allow you the setup fixed or mock responses. You will notice the _default.json_ file on the right hand side window. That contain sample content provided for mock or fixed responses on the center window display. These can be tested by running the Postman scripts supplied in the root directory of this project.

![Opening  Sync Response Rules](/assets/images/Opening_Sync_Response_Rules.png)

Below is a sample **MOCK_RESPONSE**

![Sample - Mock Response](/assets/images/Mock-Response-Sample.png)

Below is a sample **FIXED_RESPONSE**

![Sample - Fixed Response](/assets/images/Fixed-Response-Sample.png)

**Building your own Rules File**

It is possible to create your own file with a collection of rules to suite your specific requirements. For an comprehensive insight, please view [Rules Engine](../RULES_ENGINE.md) document. 

The following section will provide an overview into building your own Rules file. 

On the left window, click the _New Rules File_ tab in the top left window. Provide an appropriate file name. Remember to save it with a _**.json**_ extension.

![Creating New Rule File](/assets/images/Creating-New-Rule-File2.png)

Click on the _Add a new Rule_ button on the middle top center window. The _**Rule Builder**_ window will popup. 

First thing to do is to select the desired _**API**_ from the drop down. All the current supported API's are listed in the drop down list. 

![Select API](/assets/images/Rule-Builder-Select-API.png)

Next you will need to select the _operationId_ you require for the new rule. All the _operationId_'s are listed in the _**Resource**_ drop down list. The list is build from the Swagger definition of the selected API. 

![Resource selection](/assets/images/Resource-selection.png)

You have the option to include one or more _**CONDITION**_ for the new rule. Select the _Add Condition_ button. 

![Add Condition Button](/assets/images/Add-Condition-Button.png)

You will be presented with 4 drop down list to select from;

- _**Fact Type**_
- _**Fact**_
- _**Operation**_
- _**Value**_

Each of the above mentioned items will have present a drop down list with options to select. These selection options are as per the Swagger definition for the selected API in the above step.

![Sample Condition](/assets/images/Sample-Condition.png) 

Next step would be to select the _**EVENT**_ Type detail below. The drop down menu will provide you with the option to either select a _**Mock Response**_ or a  _**Fixed Response**_.

![Event Response Options](/assets/images/Event-Response-Options.png)

By selecting the _**Mock Response**_, you will have the option to override the standard mock response by selecting _**Override some parameters**_ tick box. This will open the _**Headers**_. Your options to select from are _**Add Header**_, _**Add Required Header**_, _**Add All Headers**_.

![Header Selection](/assets/images/Header-Selection.png)

A sample body can also be created. The data are build from the swagger definition to be correct for the data type. There are no real "value" to the sample data, but it can be edited in the editing console to be meaning full for testing purposes.

Click on the _Populate with sample body_ button. The editing window will be filled with the sample data for the body of the selected _**Resource**_ _operationId_.

![Populate with sample body](/assets/images/Populate-with-sample-body.png)

Update the sample body if so required. 

![Updated sample body data](/assets/images/Updated-sample-body-data.png)

The body of the response can be configured. Click on the _**Add Configurable Params**_. The _**Select a Configurable Parameter**_ window will pop-up with a list of valid selections. Once completed, the _**Configured Parameter**_ is copied to clipboard by clicking on the completed ```{$request.body.state}```. This can then be used within the later as can be seen in the sample rules below image.

![Using Configurable Parameter](/assets/images/Using-Configurable-Parameter.png)

Once completed, you should save the newly create rule by selecting the _save_ button on the top of the _**Rule Builder**_ window.

This will provide a summarized view of the newly create rule, similar to the samples provided.

![Summarized view of Rule](/assets/images/Summarized-view-of-Rule.png)

Going forward, the option exist to updated the rule or delete it by selecting the appropriate button - _**Edit**_ or _**Delete**_.

Lastly, set the new rule file as active by selecting the new rule file on the right hand side window and selecting the _**Set as active**_ button. You will see the **‚àö** mark next to it to indicate it is active.

#### 3.5 Validation Rules 

**_Error Callbacks_**

The setup and functionality is similar to [3.4 Sync Response Rules](#34-sync-response-rules) with the ability to create your own Rules file. This has already been explained in the previous section under **Building your own Rules File**

![Validation Rules Screen](/assets/images/validation-rules-screen.png)

#### 3.6 Callback Rules

**_Success Callbacks_**

The same applies for this section, the functionality is similar to [3.4 Sync Response Rules](#34-sync-response-rules) with the ability to create your own Rules file. This has already been explained in the previous section under **Building your own Rules File**

![Callback Rules Screen](/assets/images/callback-rules-screen.png)

#### 3.7 Outbound Request

This sections will enable you to create a collection of operations and add a number of assertions to these operations. The assertions can be setup and customised to the testing requirements and verify both positive and negative requests and callback data. 

Selecting the _**Outbound Request**_ navigation tab on the left side, you will be welcomed with the following display. 

![Outbound display opening](/assets/images/Outbound-Display-Opening.png)

At the top of the screen, you will notice the following buttons on the main window, starting from the left.

- Import Template
- New Template
- Show Template
- Save
- Send

By selecting the _**Import Template**_ button, it will allow you to import your own template. There are some sample templates for you to explore. On the file explorer window that pop up if you select the _**Import Template**_ button, navigate to the sub directory _test-case_ within the project. Select the _dfsp_tests.json_ file. This sample file consist of a couple of tests samples. Open the file to import into the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** application.

![Import Template](/assets/images/Import-Template.png)

The sample template contains, among others, the following requests as samples;

1.P2P Transfer Happy Path
- **get/parties/{Type}/{ID}** - Get party information
- **post/quotes** - Get quote
- **post/transfers** - Send transfer

![Opened Imported Template](/assets/images/Opened-Imported-Template.png)

It is possible to update the _**Input Values**_ on the right hand side window. Additional input values can be added, by selecting the _**Add Input Value**_ button on the top right of this right hand side window. These data types will need to be correct as per the selected API swagger definition.

___out of date starts here
Below the **Input Values**, you will notice the API operation Id with a description and the content of the request. The **Request** reflects both the appropriate _Header_ and _Body_ that makes up the request as per the API swagger definition.

![Sample Request](/assets/images/Sample-Request.png)

From 1 to a _n_ number of requests can be setup/created. By selecting the **Send** button on the left top, these requests will execute. The response Tab will appear on top, allowing the Response data to be review, as per the sample failure below.

![Sample Response Failure](/assets/images/Sample-Response-Failure.png)
___out of date stops here

#### 3.8 Settings

The _**SETTINGS**_ navigation tab will open to the following view. This is the default view without **Mojaloop Connection Manager** activated. 

![Opening Default Settings](/assets/images/Opening-Default-Settings.png)

The _**SETTINGS**_ window consist og the following to windows;

On the right _**Runtime Global Configuration**_ displays the environmental setting as stipulated in the _local.env_ file. 

On the left _**Edit Global Configuration**_ amounts a couple of other options, it allows you to edit and override the environment variables by selecting the _**Override with Environment Variable**_ tick box.

![Override with Environment Variable](/assets/images/Override-with-Environment-Variable.png)

### 4. Connection Manager

To incorporate security and authenticity validation the **Mojaloop Connection Manager** can be activated as part of the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**. This will allow the incorporation of TLS validations as part of the process.

#### 4.1 TLS on local Docker

This section will guide you in the required configuration updates to enable running with TLS enabled in a local docker container environment.

The following configurations on the local file system. Remember to save the files when the config is completed.

- [local.env](../local.env) file under the root directory;
  
  - update _CALLBACK_ENDPOINT_ to **HTTPS**,
  
  - update _INBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED_ to **true**,
  
  - Update _OUTBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED_ to **true**.
	
```
CALLBACK_ENDPOINT=https://scheme-adapter:4000
.
.
.
INBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED=true
OUTBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED=true
```

![Local Enabled Mutual TLS](/assets/images/Local_Mutual_TLS_Enabled.png)

- [/simulator/scheme-adapter.env](../simulator/scheme-adapter.env) file, make the following update;
  
  - Update _INBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED_ to **true**,
  
  - Update _OUTBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED_ to **true**.

```
INBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED=true
OUTBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED=true
```

![Adapter Enabled Mutual TLS](/assets/images/Adapter_Mutual_TLS_Enabled.png)
		
The TLS certificates and key have already been pre generated and populated for use in docker. For information purposes ,the configuration and location are defined in the file content as per the below image. 

![TLS Certificates and Key](/assets/images/TLS_Certs_Keys.png)

The current configuration caters for a local setup within a docker container. 

Current setup for **Mojaloop Simulator** pointing to _scheme-adapter_ as part of the docker containers.

![Simulator Pointing to Scheme-adapter](/assets/images/Simulator-Scheme-adapter-endpoint.png)

Current setup for **Mojaloop Testing- Toolkit** pointing to _mojaloop-testing-toolkit_ as part of the docker containers.
 
![ML Testing Toolkit Pointing to mojaloop-testing-toolkit](/assets/images/Testing-Toolkit -Mojaloop-Testing-Toolkit-endpoint.png)

#### 4.2 Enabling TLS Verification

As we have made updates to the configuration files for both **Mojaloop Simulator** and **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**, we will need to restart both docker containers. In the appropriate terminal windows for the 2 applications, stop the docker containers by pressing **Ctrl + C** simultaneously on the keyboard in each terminal window. This actions should "Gracefully stop" the respective docker containers. To insure all the docker containers are in fact down, run the following command in the respective terminal windows.

```
docker-compose down
```  
You should still verify that all containers are down by running the below. There shouldn't be any active docker containers.

```
docker-compose ps
```
You should see the following on the respective terminal windows

```
Name   Command   State   Ports
------------------------------
```

To enable the integration with **Mojaloop Connection Manager**, you will need to open a new terminal window to bring up the **Mojaloop Connection Manage** docker container. The **Mojaloop Connection Manager** is part of the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** download, and you can just navigate to the respective repository. Change directory into _/connection-manager_.

```
cd connection-manager
```

Now the restart **Mojaloop Simulator** and **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**, you can simply run the below command in the respective terminal windows. The containers will startup as per the initial instructions in the [README](../README.md) document.

```
docker-compose up
``` 
To start **Mojaloop Connection Manager** as part of the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**, the same command can be executed in the respective terminal window.

```
docker-compose up
```  

To verify if you are running with TLS enabled, navigate to the _**Settings**_ on the right hand navigation plain and select _**Settings**_.

As per the initial configurations that was done on the _local.env_ files, you will notice on the _**Runtime Global Configuration**_ window on the right the following 3 settings;

- Callback URL starts with https://
- Enable Inbound Mutual TLS is |‚àö|
- Enable Outbound Mutual TLS is |‚àö|

![TLS Enabled on Environment](/assets/images/TLS-Enabled-on-Environment.png)

To do a quick verification if everything is still functioning as expected, you can repeat the simulator test done in 3.3 [Monitoring](#33-monitoring).

#### 4.3 Alternative Setups

It is also possible for **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** to function outside of a local docker environment, enabling more advance integration testing and verifications between a Mojaloop Switch and testing DFSP before going live. 

To familiarize yourself with the process, you can create your own TLS certificate. Script files are provided to speed up the process to generate these certificates for both the **Mojaloop Simulator** and **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**. 

- **Mojaloop Simulator** the file path /simulator/secrets/tls/createSecrets.sh
- **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** the file path /secrets/tls/createSecrets.sh

Please be aware should you setup on another environment , some variables will need to be updated like DNS or IP address of the server.

We will be covering the setting up and activation of the certificates in more depth in a seperate document. This will including the actions required on **Mojaloop Connection Manager** interface.
